Hope you enjoyed this ASCII art, it took longer than I expected...

Anyways, thank you for downloading the April Fools update of Low-Bit Mayhem! This version actually features the original version of Bit-Beat, Sixty-Boll from NKO. You might potentially remember hearing it from a teaser on the NKO Twitter/Bluesky (and me reposting it). This version of the song was scrapped due to Staw leaving the team of NKO. However, I still liked the song, so I asked Staw if we could potentially make the song its own mod, thus Low-Bit Mayhem was created. I felt for April Fools, it felt right to release this version to the public with little changes as sort of a look at how far we come.

If you're interested in checking out NKO, you can follow them on Twitter (@NKODevs) and Bluesky (@nkoofficial.bsky.social) for updates, teasers, etc. You can also follow the new official Low-Bit Mayhem accounts on Bluesky (@lowbitmayhemfnf.bsky.social) and Twitter (@LowBitMayhemFNF) for updates on this mod.

Hope to see you for Low-Bit Mayhem V2!

P.S. We may have left a secret in the game in the ending screen, not spoiling where and how you find it :)




Staw, if you're reading this, you are such a great musician and thank you for letting me make Low-Bit Mayhem a reality. I hope we can continue working to make even more projects like Low-Bit Mayhem v2 as best as we can make them.
